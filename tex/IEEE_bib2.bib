    abstract = { Reinforcement learning is the problem of generating optimal behavior in a sequential decision-making environment given the opportunity of interacting with it. Many algorithms for solving reinforcement-learning problems work by computing improved estimates of the optimal value function. We extend prior analyses of reinforcement-learning algorithms and present a powerful new theorem that can provide a unified analysis of such value-function-based reinforcement-learning algorithms. The usefulness of the theorem lies in how it allows the convergence of a complex asynchronous reinforcement-learning algorithm to be proved by verifying that a simpler synchronous algorithm converges. We illustrate the application of the theorem by analyzing the convergence of Q-learning, model-based reinforcement learning, Q-learning with multistate updates, Q-learning for Markov games, and risk-sensitive reinforcement learning. }

abstract="We describe a simple yet general method to analyze networks of coupled identical nonlinear oscillators and study applications to fast synchronization, locomotion, and schooling. Specifically, we use nonlinear contraction theory to derive exact and global (rather than linearized) results on synchronization, antisynchronization, and oscillator death. The method can be applied to coupled networks of various structures and arbitrary size. For oscillators with positive definite diffusion coupling, it can be shown that synchronization always occurs globally for strong enough coupling strengths, and an explicit upper bound on the corresponding threshold can be computed through eigenvalue analysis. The discussion also extends to the case when network structure varies abruptly and asynchronously, as in ``flocks'' of oscillators or dynamic elements.",

  abstract={In economics, most noncooperative game theory has focused on equilibrium in games, especially Nash equilibrium and its refinements. The traditional explanation for when and why equilibrium arises is that it results from analysis and introspection by the players in a situation where the rules of the game, the rationality of the players, and the players' payoff functions are all common knowledge. Both conceptually and empirically, this theory has many problems. In The Theory of Learning in Games Drew Fudenberg and David Levine develop an alternative explanation that equilibrium arises as the long-run outcome of a process in which less than fully rational players grope for optimality over time. The models they explore provide a foundation for equilibrium theory and suggest useful ways for economists to evaluate and modify traditional equilibrium concepts.},
